# JAT_potential
JAT (JraphAttentionNetworks), a deep learning architecture to predict the potential energy and forces of molecules. The architecture uses message passing neural networks with an attentional update function (linear dynamic attention, GATv2) by adapting Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to the domain of computational chemistry.
